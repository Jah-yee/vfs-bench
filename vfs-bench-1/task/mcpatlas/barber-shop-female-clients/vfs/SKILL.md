# Available commands

Standard Unix commands, among them:

    cat  head  tail  ls  find  grep  wc  sort  uniq  cut  tr  sed  awk
    diff  tee  xargs  jq

with pipes, `>` redirection and `$(...)` substitution.

Do not probe the machine with `which`, `type`, `--version`, `env`, `ps`,
`echo $PATH`, `ls /usr/bin` or `cat /usr/bin/<command>`: they tell you
nothing about the task.

A filename with a space in it needs quoting, as it would in any shell.

## airtable

Use `airtable <command> '<JSON arguments>'`. Run `airtable <command> --help`
to get more information.

```sh
airtable list-bases '{}'
```

| Command | Arguments | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `airtable list-bases` | `{}` | List all accessible Airtable bases |

## arxiv

Use `arxiv <command> '<JSON arguments>'`. Run `arxiv <command> --help` to
get more information.

```sh
arxiv search-papers '{"query":"QUERY","max_results":5}'
```

| Command | Arguments | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `arxiv search-papers` | `{query: str, max_results?: int, date_from?: str, date_to?: str, categories?: list[str]}` | Search for papers on arXiv with advanced filtering |

## python3

Execute Python code and return stdout and stderr. Code can be pasted into a
`.py` file and run with `python3`. Python cannot launch subprocesses or make
direct network requests. Run the documented service commands directly in
the shell. Use Python for local file processing and generating JSON
arguments.
