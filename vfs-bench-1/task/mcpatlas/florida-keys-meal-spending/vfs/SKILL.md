# Available commands

Standard Unix commands, among them:

    cat  head  tail  ls  find  grep  wc  sort  uniq  cut  tr  sed  awk
    diff  tee  xargs  jq

with pipes, `>` redirection and `$(...)` substitution.

Do not probe the machine with `which`, `type`, `--version`, `env`, `ps`,
`echo $PATH`, `ls /usr/bin` or `cat /usr/bin/<command>`: they tell you
nothing about the task.

A filename with a space in it needs quoting, as it would in any shell.

You can also use `gh` for GitHub.

## google-workspace

Use `google-workspace <command> '<JSON arguments>'`. Run
`google-workspace <command> --help` to get more information.

```sh
google-workspace list-events '{"timeMin":"YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00Z","timeMax":"YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00Z","maxResults":50}'
```

| Command | Arguments | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `google-workspace list-events` | `{maxResults?: number, timeMin?: str, timeMax?: str}` | List upcoming calendar events |

## memory

Use `memory <command> '<JSON arguments>'`. Run `memory <command> --help` to
get more information.

```sh
memory search-nodes '{"query":"QUERY"}'
memory open-nodes '{"names":["NAME"]}'
```

| Command | Arguments | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `memory search-nodes` | `{query: str}` | Search for nodes in the knowledge graph based on a query |
| `memory open-nodes` | `{names: list[str]}` | Open specific nodes in the knowledge graph by their names |

## calculator

Use `calculator <command> '<JSON arguments>'`. Run
`calculator <command> --help` to get more information.

```

| Command | Arguments | Description |

## python3

Execute Python code and return stdout and stderr. Code can be pasted into a
`.py` file and run with `python3`. Python cannot launch subprocesses or make
direct network requests. Run the documented service commands directly in
the shell. Use Python for local file processing and generating JSON
arguments.
