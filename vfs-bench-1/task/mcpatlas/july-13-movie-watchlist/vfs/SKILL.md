# Available commands

Python (`python` or `python3`), Perl, JavaScript/Node.js, and TypeScript
runtimes are unavailable. Use the shell commands and task CLIs documented
below; do not probe for or attempt to install other runtimes.

Standard Unix commands, among them:

    cat  head  tail  ls  find  grep  wc  sort  uniq  cut  tr  sed  awk
    diff  tee  xargs  jq

with pipes, `>` redirection and `$(...)` substitution.

Do not probe the machine with `which`, `type`, `--version`, `env`, `ps`,
`echo $PATH`, `ls /usr/bin` or `cat /usr/bin/<command>`: they tell you
nothing about the task.

A filename with a space in it needs quoting, as it would in any shell.

Avoid `grep -r` and `find` over the whole of `/data`: search the directory
or file you need.

You can also use `gh` for GitHub and `git`.
