# Available commands

Python (`python` or `python3`), Perl, JavaScript/Node.js, and TypeScript
runtimes are unavailable. Use the shell commands and task CLIs documented
below; do not probe for or attempt to install other runtimes.

Standard Unix commands, among them:

    cat  head  tail  ls  find  grep  wc  sort  uniq  cut  tr  sed  awk
    diff  tee  xargs  jq

with pipes, `>` redirection and `$(...)` substitution.

Do not probe the machine with `which`, `type`, `--version`, `env`, `ps`,
`echo $PATH`, `ls /usr/bin` or `cat /usr/bin/<command>`: they tell you
nothing about the task.

A filename with a space in it needs quoting, as it would in any shell.

You can also use `gh` for GitHub.

|---|---|---|
| `context7 resolve-library-id` | `{libraryName: str}` | Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID and returns a list of matching libraries. |
| `context7 get-library-docs` | `{context7CompatibleLibraryID: str, topic?: str, tokens?: number}` | Fetches up-to-date documentation for a library. You must call 'resolve-library-id' first to obtain the exact Context7-compatible library ID required to use this tool, UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version' in their query. |
