# Available commands

Python (`python` or `python3`), Perl, JavaScript/Node.js, and TypeScript
runtimes are unavailable. Use the shell commands and task CLIs documented
below; do not probe for or attempt to install other runtimes.

Standard Unix commands, among them:

    cat  head  tail  ls  find  grep  wc  sort  uniq  cut  tr  sed  awk
    diff  tee  xargs  jq  unzip

with pipes, `>` redirection, `$(...)` substitution and `$'...'`.

The task CLIs below are registered with this shell rather than installed
as files; do not inspect them with `which`, `file` or `/usr/bin`.

| `browser file-upload` | `{paths: list[str]}` | Upload one or multiple files — `paths`: The absolute paths to the files to upload. Can be a single file or multiple files. |
| `browser install` | `{}` | Install the browser specified in the config. Call this if you get an error about the browser not being installed. |

Useful for triggering key handlers in the page. By default entire text is filled in at once. |
| `browser navigate` | `{url: str}` | Navigate to a URL — `url`: The URL to navigate to |
| `browser navigate-back` | `{}` | Go back to the previous page |
| `browser navigate-forward` | `{}` | Go forward to the next page |
| `browser network-requests` | `{}` | Returns all network requests since loading the page |
| `browser take-screenshot` | `{raw?: bool, filename?: str, element?: str, ref?: str, fullPage?: bool}` | Take a screenshot of the current page. You can't perform actions based on the screenshot, use browser_snapshot for actions. — `raw`: Whether to return without compression (in PNG format). Default is false, which returns a JPEG image.; `filename`: File name to save the screenshot to. Defaults to `page-{timestamp}.{png\|jpeg}` if not specified.; `element`: Human-readable element description used to obtain permission to screenshot the element. If not provided, the screenshot will be taken of viewport. If element is provided, ref must be provided too.; `ref`: Exact target element reference from the page snapshot. If not provided, the screenshot will be taken of viewport. If ref is provided, element must be provided too.; `fullPage`: When true, takes a screenshot of the full scrollable page, instead of the currently visible viewport. Cannot be used with element screenshots. |
| `browser snapshot` | `{}` | Capture accessibility snapshot of the current page. The snapshot is divided into manageable spans (configurable via --span-size, default 2000 characters, or use -1 to show complete snapshot) and shows the first span by default. Use browser_snapshot_navigate_* tools to view other spans or browser_snapshot_search to find content across all spans. This provides structured element data with ref attributes for interaction, making it better than screenshots for automation. |
| `browser click` | `{element: str, ref: str, doubleClick?: bool, button?: "left" \| "right" \| "middle"}` | Perform click on a web page — `element`: Human-readable element description used to obtain permission to interact with the element; `ref`: Exact target element reference from the page snapshot; `doubleClick`: Whether to perform a double click instead of a single click; `button`: Button to click, defaults to left |

| `browser hover` | `{element: str, ref: str}` | Hover over element on page — `element`: Human-readable element description used to obtain permission to interact with the element; `ref`: Exact target element reference from the page snapshot |
| `browser select-option` | `{element: str, ref: str, values: list[str]}` | Select an option in a dropdown — `element`: Human-readable element description used to obtain permission to interact with the element; `ref`: Exact target element reference from the page snapshot; `values`: Array of values to select in the dropdown. This can be a single value or multiple values. |
| `browser snapshot-navigate-to-span` | `{spanIndex: int}` | Navigate to a specific span in the current page snapshot by index. Each span contains a portion of the page content (limited by span size). Use this when you know the exact span number you want to view, typically after using browser_snapshot_search to locate content. — `spanIndex`: The span index to navigate to (0-based) |
| `browser snapshot-navigate-to-first-span` | `{}` | Navigate to the first span of the current page snapshot. This shows the beginning of the page content and is useful for starting from the top of the page when exploring content sequentially. |
| `browser snapshot-navigate-to-last-span` | `{}` | Navigate to the last span of the current page snapshot. This shows the end of the page content and is useful for accessing footer content, final form elements, or bottom navigation. |
| `browser snapshot-navigate-to-next-span` | `{}` | Navigate to the next span in the current page snapshot. If already at the last span, stays at the last span. Use this for sequential exploration of page content from top to bottom. |

| `browser snapshot-search` | `{pattern: str, flags?: str}` | Search for a pattern across all spans of the current page snapshot using regular expressions. Returns matches with both global line numbers (across entire snapshot) and in-span line numbers (within each span). Shows which spans contain matches for navigation. Supports regex flags like "gi" for global case-insensitive search. — `pattern`: The regex pattern to search for; `flags`: Optional regex flags (e.g., "gi" for global case-insensitive) |
| `browser tab-list` | `{}` | List browser tabs |
| `browser tab-new` | `{url?: str}` | Open a new tab — `url`: The URL to navigate to in the new tab. If not provided, the new tab will be blank. |
