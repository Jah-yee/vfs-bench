## python3

Execute Python code directly under the agent workspace and return stdout
and stderr. Code can be pasted into a `.py` file and run with `python3`.

Python cannot launch subprocesses or make direct network requests. Run the
documented service commands directly in the shell. Use Python for local
file processing and generating JSON arguments.
