# Available commands

Standard Unix commands, among them:

    cat  head  tail  ls  find  grep  wc  sort  uniq  cut  tr  sed  awk
    diff  tee  xargs  jq  unzip  curl

with pipes, `>` redirection, `$(...)` substitution and `$'...'`.

The task CLIs below are registered with this shell rather than installed
as files; do not inspect them with `which`, `file` or `/usr/bin`.

## python3

Execute Python code directly under the agent workspace and return stdout
and stderr. Code can be pasted into a `.py` file and run with `python3`.

Python cannot launch subprocesses or make direct network requests. Run the
documented service commands directly in the shell. Use Python for local
file processing and generating JSON arguments.
