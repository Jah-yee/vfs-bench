# Virtual Filesystem

You work in a terminal over a virtual filesystem. Read files with shell
commands; service operations are listed in SKILL.md.

| Path | Description |
|---|---|
| `/workspace` | Agent workspace; current directory and home (`~`). |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files. |
| `/dev` | Device files: `null` and `zero` (mounted automatically). |
| `/woo` | WooCommerce service objects, read-only; change them with the `woocommerce` CLI. |
| `/mail` | Mail folders and messages, read-only; change them with the `emails` CLI. |
