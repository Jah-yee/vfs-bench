# Available commands

Python (`python` or `python3`), Perl, JavaScript/Node.js, and TypeScript
runtimes are unavailable. Use the shell commands and task CLIs documented
below; do not probe for or attempt to install other runtimes.

Standard Unix commands, among them:

    cat  head  tail  ls  find  grep  wc  sort  uniq  cut  tr  sed  awk
    diff  tee  xargs  jq  unzip

with pipes, `>` redirection, `$(...)` substitution and `$'...'`.

The task CLIs below are registered with this shell rather than installed
as files; do not inspect them with `which`, `file` or `/usr/bin`.
