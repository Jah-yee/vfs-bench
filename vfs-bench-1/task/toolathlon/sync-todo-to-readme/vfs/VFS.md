# Virtual Filesystem

You work in a terminal over a virtual filesystem. Read files with shell
commands; service operations are listed in SKILL.md.

| Path | Description |
|---|---|
| `/workspace` | Agent workspace; current directory and home (`~`). |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files. |
| `/dev` | Device files: `null` and `zero` (mounted automatically). |
| `/repo/main` | GitHub repository `integ-user/LUFFY`, ref `main`, read-only; change it with the `gh` CLI. |
| `/repo/dev` | GitHub repository `integ-user/LUFFY`, ref `dev`, read-only; change it with the `gh` CLI. |
